## Description

This is a random password generator website that was created in order to display my JavaScript skills. When the user clicks "Generate Password", they will then get a series of prompts. The first prompt will allow the user to input a password length between 8 and 128. The next prompts ask the user if they would like lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.
